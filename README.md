MLXTextSummarizer is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that leverages machine learning to create concise summaries of text inputs. The app produces three outputs from any provided text:

-   **A short title:**  A very concise headline summarizing the input.
    
-   **A detailed summary:**  A succinct recap of the main points in the input text.
    
-   **Three tags:**  Single-word descriptors generated in a JSON array format, highlighting key themes.
    

The project demonstrates how to integrate model inference, along with haptic feedback to create a polished user experience.
